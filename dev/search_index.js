In Bayes's Law, we have\n\nP(θx)  P(θ) P(xθ)\n\nHere P(θ) is the prior. If we consider P(xθ) as a function on θ, then it is called a likelihood.\n\nSince measures are most commonly manipulated using density and logdensity, it's awkward to commit a (log-)likelihood to using one or the other. To evaluate a Likelihood, we therefore use density or logdensity, depending on the circumstances. In the latter case, it is of course acting as a log-density.\n\nFor example,\n\njulia> ℓ = Likelihood(Normal{(:μ,)}, 2.0)\nLikelihood(Normal{(:μ,), T} where T, 2.0)\n\njulia> density(ℓ, (μ=2.0,))\n1.0\n\njulia> logdensity(ℓ, (μ=2.0,))\n-0.0\n\nIf, as above, the measure includes the parameter information, we can optionally leave it out of the second argument in the call to density or logdensity. \n\njulia> density(ℓ, 2.0)\n1.0\n\njulia> logdensity(ℓ, 2.0)\n-0.0\n\nWith several parameters, things work as expected:\n\njulia> ℓ = Likelihood(Normal{(:μ,:σ)}, 2.0)\nLikelihood(Normal{(:μ, :σ), T} where T, 2.0)\n\njulia> logdensity(ℓ, (μ=2, σ=3))\n-1.0986122886681098\n\njulia> logdensity(ℓ, (2,3))\n-1.0986122886681098\n\njulia> logdensity(ℓ, [2, 3])\n-1.0986122886681098\n\n\n\nLikelihood(M<:ParameterizedMeasure, constraint::NamedTuple, x)\n\nIn some cases the measure might have several parameters, and we may want the (log-)likelihood with respect to some subset of them. In this case, we can use the three-argument form, where the second argument is a constraint. For example,\n\njulia> ℓ = Likelihood(Normal{(:μ,:σ)}, (σ=3.0,), 2.0)\nLikelihood(Normal{(:μ, :σ), T} where T, (σ = 3.0,), 2.0)\n\nSimilarly to the above, we have\n\njulia> density(ℓ, (μ=2.0,))\n0.3333333333333333\n\njulia> logdensity(ℓ, (μ=2.0,))\n-1.0986122886681098\n\njulia> density(ℓ, 2.0)\n0.3333333333333333\n\njulia> logdensity(ℓ, 2.0)\n-1.0986122886681098\n\n\n\nFinally, let's return to the expression for Bayes's Law, \n\nP(θx)  P(θ) P(xθ)\n\nThe product on the right side is computed pointwise. To work with this in MeasureBase, we have a \"pointwise product\" ⊙, which takes a measure and a likelihood, and returns a new measure, that is, the unnormalized posterior that has density P(θ) P(xθ) with respect to the base measure of the prior.\n\nFor example, say we have\n\nμ ~ Normal()\nx ~ Normal(μ,σ)\nσ = 1\n\nand we observe x=3. We can compute the posterior measure on μ as\n\njulia> post = Normal() ⊙ Likelihood(Normal{(:μ, :σ)}, (σ=1,), 3)\nNormal() ⊙ Likelihood(Normal{(:μ, :σ), T} where T, (σ = 1,), 3)\n\njulia> logdensity(post, 2)\n-2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api_measurebase/#MeasureBase.SuperpositionMeasure","page":"MeasureBase","title":"MeasureBase.SuperpositionMeasure","text":"struct SuperpositionMeasure{X,NT} <: AbstractMeasure\n    components :: NT\nend\n\nSuperposition of measures is analogous to mixture distributions, but (because measures need not be normalized) requires no scaling.
